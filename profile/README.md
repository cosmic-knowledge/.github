From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansophism):

> Pansophism, in older usage often pansophy, is a concept in the educational system of universal knowledge proposed by John Amos Comenius, a Czech educator

> Pansophism was a term used generally by Comenius to describe his pedagogical philosophy. His book Pansophiae prodromus (1639) was published in London with the cooperation of Samuel Hartlib. It was followed by Pansophiae diatyposis. Pansophy in this sense has been defined as "full adult comprehension of the divine order of things"

This organization houses my universal knowledge system, a _Knowledge IDE_ of sorts. It doesn't include my knowledge base, but tools to manage it.

My goal is to replace [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and make the system as extensible as possible. Eventually, it might be useful to other people, but for now it's quite bespoke and limited in terms of functionality.
