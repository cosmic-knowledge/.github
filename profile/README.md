A cosmic-themed knowledge management system.

This organization houses my universal knowledge system, a _Knowledge IDE_ of sorts. It doesn't include my knowledge base, but tools to manage it.

My goal is to replace [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and make the system as extensible as possible. Eventually, it might be useful to other people, but for now it's quite bespoke and extremely limited in terms of functionality.
